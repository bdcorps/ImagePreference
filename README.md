# ImagePreference
Summer 2014.

This project has been upgraded from Eclipse based to Android Studio/Gradle based.

The PreferenceActivity screen in Android live wallpaper have several pre built views that can used, such as
- CheckBoxPrerefence
- ListPreference
- EditTextPreference

This project demontrates how Preference views can be extended and new custom Preference views can be built. We embed images in a custom preference view and display it in tht PreferenceActivity.
